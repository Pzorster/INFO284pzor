Common commands I seem to forget

Check version: [program] --version
x. git --version

print working directory(where you are): pwd

moving in folder structure: cd [folder]
x. cd INFO2084Gruppe
x. cd ..[takes you one level up]

clean terminal: cls

GIT setup etc.
- Initiate the git repository locally(in the directory your terminal is in): git init
- Connect your local git repository to remote one: git remote add origin <url>
- Change the URL if you wrote the wrong one: git remote set-url origin <url>
- check the url connected: remote -v
- Adding files you want to commit:
	git add <filename1> <filename2> (you can add many on by one)
	git add	directory_name/*
	git add -A directory_name or git add --all directory_name
- Commit changes: git commit -m "Your commit message"
- Push changes: git push origin <branch_name>
- Pull changes: git pull origin <branch_name>
- Connecting to an already existing repostory: 1.Navigate to desired directory. 2. git clone <repository_url>
- Check current status: git status
- Check commit history of repository: git log
- Check which branch you are on: git branch

Untested functions taken from GPT
- Create a new branch: git branch <branch_name>
- Switch branches:  git chekcout <branch_name>
- Create and switch to new branch:  git cheackout -b <branch_name>
- Merge to target branch: 1. git checkout <target_branch> 2.git merge <branch_name>
- Delete branch: git branch -d <branch_name>
- Force delete even if it has unmerged changes:  git branch -D <branch_name>
- Rebase current branch onto another one:  git rebase <target_branch>
- Combining an add all, commit and push into one command(not always recommended): git commit -am "Your commit message" && git push origin <branch_name> (the a in -am is the git add -all command)
